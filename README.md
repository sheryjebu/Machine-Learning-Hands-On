"Clustering of Travel Review Ratings Against Each Category per User"
Here in my course work I am going to implement the Machine Learning techniques in the data set, which I got from Kaggle. My dataset consists of the reviews on destinations in 10 categories mentioned across East Asia. There are 980 Instances and 11 Attributes. The data applies clustering algorithms using Python programming language with the use of scientific libraries.
